# Special Sessions

For the first time, the HEART symposium will offer special sessions on application areas where efficient acceleration and reconfigurable technologies are on the way to get higly relevant. The format of these special session is more liberal than a regular research paper sesskons and can be tailored by the organizers to suit the topic and include, for example, invited talks, panel discussions, lighning talk presentations, and interacive elements.

We are happy to annouce that we have found three organizer teams to start this new format at the HEART symposium with the following topics:

## 1. Special Session on "High-performance Computing / Data Center / Cloud“ 
Chairs: Holger Fröning (Universität Heidelberg),  Felix Zahn (CERN)

## 2, Special Session on "Mobile Systems / Edge Computing / Internet of Things“
Chairs: Smail Niar (Universityé Polytechnique Hauts-de-France),  Ihsen Alouani (Universityé Polytechnique Hauts-de-France)

## 3. Special Session on "FPGAs for HPC: Open Challenges for Infrastructure and System Operation"

### Large-scale combinatorial optimization in real-time systems by FPGA-based accelerators for simulated bifurcation


#### Abstract

Combinatorial optimization problems are economically valuable but computationally hard to solve. Many practical combinatorial optimizations can be converted to ground-state search problems of Ising spin models. Simulated bifurcation (SB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to solve these Ising problems. One of the remarkable features of SB is the high-degree parallelism, providing an opportunity for quickly solving those problems by massively parallel processing. In this talk, starting from the principles of SB, we review our recent works on the design and implementation of high-performance FPGA-based accelerators for SB and their applications toward innovative real-time systems that make optimal responses to ever-changing situations. An example of such applications is an ultrafast financial transaction machine that detects the most profitable cross-currency arbitrage opportunities at microsecond speeds. Also, we discuss the parallelism of SB in depth and show a scale-out architecture for SB-based Ising machines with all-to-all spin-spin couplings that allows continued scaling of both machine size and computational throughput by connecting multiple chips, rather than scaling up a single chip.

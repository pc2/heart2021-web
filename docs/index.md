Thanks to our generous sponsors, the HEART'21 symposium can be held as a **free online event** for all participants. To attend the conference, a **registration is required** due to legal reasons (privacy policy, etc.). The **registration portal will be open from June 11**.

We have built an attractive [conference program](https://events.uni-paderborn.de/event/119/timetable/) that includes two exciting [keynotes](keynotes.md), 8 regular research talks and a Phd forum with lightning talks. 

* [Keynote 1: Large-scale combinatorial optimization in real-time systems by FPGA-based accelerators for simulated bifurcation](https://events.uni-paderborn.de/event/119/timetable/#5-keynote-large-scale-combinat)
**Kosuke Tatsumura**, Chief Research Scientist, Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation

* [Keynote 2: Portable high-performance Python on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs](https://events.uni-paderborn.de/event/119/timetable/#8-keynote-portable-high-perfor)
**Torsten Hoefler**, ETH Zurich

In addition, we will have three [special sessions](special-sessions.md) on current hot topics:

* [Special Session 1: FPGAs for HPC: Open Challenges for Infrastructure and System Operation](https://events.uni-paderborn.de/event/119/timetable/#b-99-special-session-fpgas-for)
Chairs: Kentaro Sano (RIKEN), Tomohiro Ueno (RIKEN)

* [Special Session 2: "High-performance Computing: Open Challenges as a Result of the Growing User-Hardware Gap](https://events.uni-paderborn.de/event/119/timetable/#b-98-special-session-high-perf)
Chairs: Holger Fröning (Universität Heidelberg),  Felix Zahn (CERN)

* [Special Session 3: "Mobile Systems / Edge Computing / Internet of Things"](https://events.uni-paderborn.de/event/119/timetable/#b-97-special-session-mobile-sy)  
Chairs: Smail Niar (Universityé Polytechnique Hauts-de-France),  Ihsen Alouani (Universityé Polytechnique Hauts-de-France)

To facilitate informal discussions between participants we will provide an interactive [Gather.town](https://gather.town) space to socialize in the conference breaks.

# Overview

The International symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies (HEART) is a forum to present and discuss new research on computing systems utilizing acceleration technology. The main theme of HEART is achieving high efficiency with accelerators, which is of utmost importance across a wide spectrum of computing systems. In the high performance computing and data center domains, high efficiency mostly relates to performance, while in the mobile and IoT space research communities think about accelerators more from a power/energy perspective.

The eleventh edition of HEART will take place as a virtual conference. The symposium will be held from June 21–23 2021.

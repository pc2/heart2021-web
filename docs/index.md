# Overview

The International symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies (HEART) is a forum to present and discuss new research on computing systems utilizing acceleration technology. The main theme of HEART is achieving high efficiency with accelerators, which is of utmost importance across a wide spectrum of computing systems. In the high performance computing and data center domains, high efficiency mostly relates to performance, while in the mobile and IoT space research communities think about accelerators more from a power/energy perspective.

The eleventh edition of HEART will take place as a virtual conference. The symposium will be held from June 21â€“23 2021.

# Special Sessions

In addition to the regular scientific paper sessions, HEART'21 will also feature special sessions on specific topics. So far, the following special sessions have been announced:

* High-performance Computing / Data Center / Cloud
* Mobile Systems / Edge Computing / Internet of Things
